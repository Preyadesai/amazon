# 🛒 Mini Amazon – Console-Based E-Commerce System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a console-based Mini Amazon / E-Commerce system built using Python.  
It simulates a simplified online shopping platform where users can register, log in, browse products, manage a shopping cart, and place orders.

The system uses JSON file storage for data persistence and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with modular design.
